<p>Let us first go over what is public domain and what is private. Denver City ordinances require that sidewalks be maintained by property owners.
	 See link <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/streetsandsidewalks/StreetsandSidewalks/StreetMaintenanceImprovement/tabid/437887/Default.aspx">Sidewalks</a>
	 and link <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Portals/730/documents/ConstructionInspection/maintenance_of_impro.pdf">Maintenance</a>.
	 Although if you rent you are still be responsible for snow and ice removal it should be in your rental agreement. 
	 If someone slips and falls on your sidewalk due to your negligence then you are responsible for damages. 
	 It should be covered under your home owners insurance if not then you will have to pay for damages yourself. 
	 Anyway it is irresponsible not to shovel your walk and maintain it.

You could of course do it yourself with a couple bags of concrete and a free weekend, but the kids will probably write their names in it
 with some curse words for decoration. I remember my dad did some patchwork on our curbs and sidewalks when I was a kid. 
 He then sat on the porch with a book and waited for it to dry. Grade school crushes come and go but concrete lasts a lot longer.</p>
